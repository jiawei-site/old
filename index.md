## About

##### Find my CV [here](assets/pdf/jiawei_cv.pdf).

I am a 1st-year CS PhD student at [UIUC](https://illinois.edu/) advised by [Lingming Zhang](http://lingming.cs.illinois.edu/). I obtained my B.Eng degree from Tongji University.

My primary research goal is to make future software infrastructures: **easy-to-use**, **high-performance** and **reliable**. I was a research intern at [Alibaba DAMO Academy](https://damo.alibaba.com/?lang=en), scaling distributed computing for large-scale data processing. Prior to that, I have been building general-purpose video analytic frameworks with [Jinyang Li](http://www.news.cs.nyu.edu/~jinyang/) at [NYU System Group](http://news.cs.nyu.edu/). I am also the leading committer of [HyperPose](https://github.com/tensorlayer/hyperpose) (1k stars), a blazing-fast pose estimation framework on GPU (advised by [Luo Mai](https://luomai.github.io/) and [Hao Dong](https://zsdonghao.github.io/)). Previously, I was an intern at [ByteDance](https://www.bytedance.com/en/) [AI Lab](https://ailab.bytedance.com/), developing deep learning model servers.

During my undergraduate study, I have been focusing on high-performance Machine Learning Systems (MLSys) research, including model serving, distributed training, ML-driven video analytics, and ML/RL for systems. I'm also exploring new directions for doing a PhD, e.g., MLSys Reliability.

## Misc.

Digital painting and cooking are my hobbies if coding is not allowed to be taken into account.
I spent most of my spare time watching (Japanese) anime and all kinds of suspense films, and discussing interesting tech stuff with my friends.

`ganler` is the most commonly used nickname of mine, which is from my favorite animation *デュラララ!! (DURARARA!!)*.

My Chinese name is 刘佳伟.
