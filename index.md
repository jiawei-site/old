# About

##### You can check my CV [here](assets/pdf/jiawei_cv.pdf).

I'm a research intern at [Alibaba DAMO Academy](https://damo.alibaba.com/?lang=en) and an incoming CS PhD student at [UIUC](https://illinois.edu/) advised by [Lingming Zhang](http://lingming.cs.illinois.edu/). I obtained my B.Eng degree from Tongji University.

My primary research goal is to facilitate high-quality software infrastructures: **easy-to-use**, **high-performance** and **reliable**. I have been building general-purpose video analytic frameworks with [Jinyang Li](http://www.news.cs.nyu.edu/~jinyang/) at [NYU System Group](http://news.cs.nyu.edu/). I am also the leading committer of [HyperPose](https://github.com/tensorlayer/hyperpose) (1k stars), a blazing-fast pose estimation framework on GPU (advised by [Luo Mai](https://luomai.github.io/) and [Hao Dong](https://zsdonghao.github.io/)). Previously, I was an intern at [ByteDance](https://www.bytedance.com/en/) [AI Lab](https://ailab.bytedance.com/), developing deep learning model servers.

During my undergraduate study, I have been focusing on high-performance Machine Learning Systems (MLSys) research, including model serving, distributed training, ML-driven video analytics, and ML/RL for systems. I'm also exploring new directions for doing a PhD, e.g., MLSys Reliability.

This is my new personal website! I am deprecating my <a href="https://jw-liu.xyz/">previous website</a> since it was made complicated for graduate school application.

# Misc.

Digital painting and cooking are my hobbies if coding is not allowed to be taken into account.
Well, if allowed, I enjoy myself being a language lawyer (though not quite qualified) of modern C++ and reading thick books (sounds quite like a nerd).
I spent most of my spare time watching (Japanese) anime and all kinds of suspense films, and discussing interesting tech stuff with my friends (who are also some kind of nerds, lol).

`ganler` is the most commonly used nickname of mine, which is from my favorite animation *デュラララ!! (DURARARA!!)*.

My Chinese name is 刘佳伟.
